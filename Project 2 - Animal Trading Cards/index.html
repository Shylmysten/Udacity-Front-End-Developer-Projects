			<p>The Jack Russell Terrier, though small, is full of boundless energy. He likes to run and dig, so it's important to give him lots of exercise each day through walks or a long game of fetch with his favorite ball. You should also keep him on a leash or provide a sturdy fence around your yard to keep him contained because they are very social and will happily visit the neighbors if let out of your sight. </p>
