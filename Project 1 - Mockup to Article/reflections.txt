My Reflections so far?

•	What new skills have you learned?

Not being new to HTML and CSS, there is not much new here that I learned, however, I did have a couple refreshers on superscript and strikethroughs. I had forgotten about those tags because I had been doing the same thing for so long with CSS. I think the markup is the easiest part of it all, as sometimes CSS can get really tricky. It’s come a looooong ways from the early days.

•	What has been easy?

Up to this point, pretty much everything was easy for me. It was mostly refresher material for me, but it was kept interesting by the videos and the tree analogy. I was really hoping to learn some of the more advanced CSS topics.

•	What has been difficult?

I’ve not had arrived at anything in the course yet that I would really consider difficult or really challenging…key word, yet! Overall, I thought the courses were really taught well, and well structured.

•	How have you used the problem-solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Not, really…however, I did have slow myself down and really read what was being asked in some of the quizzes.
